- I am holder of Master's qualification in Data Science with Distinction and First-Class Honours Bachelor's degree in Computer Software Development.
- I successfully completed Principles of Data Science, Applied Statistics and Data Mining, Big Data Tools and Techniques, and Advanced Databases modules in my master's course.
- I have professional experience as a data scientist in extracting, transforming, understanding, cleaning, analysing, training data/big data, hypothesis testing, implementing machine learning algorithms as well as solid programming, mathematical, and problem-solving skills.
- I have recently completed my master's project at Irwin Mitchell LLP with Distinction. In this project, I built a propensity model to identify a subset of clients to target with Asset Management services of Irwin Mitchell. This model can lead to gathering thousands of pounds of assets under management.
- In my MSc project at Irwin Mitchell, I met all the objectives and the steps in the project plan were stuck to quite closely. During this collaboration, I established good relations with a circle of professionals as I strongly believe in teamwork.
- This one year of experience enhanced my experience in the field of Data. Now I am seeking a data related position in the UK IT industry to utilize my hands-on experience and enhance my educational and professional skills.[CV21UK.pdf](https://github.com/ronaghi/ronaghi/files/9126235/CV21UK.pdf)
